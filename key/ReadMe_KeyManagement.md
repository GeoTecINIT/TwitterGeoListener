# Key Provider
This folder contains all authentication files for :
- Twitter API
- Google
- MongoDB Server

# Set your own files
This file just contains example files since quotas and security options are important for UJI, Google and Twitter accounts.
Each File has variables that must be used to easily access those services.
Set your files and remove the '_Example' text from names and it will work


# Not working???
let me know if something is not working with configuration files, then hopefully we can deal with it
